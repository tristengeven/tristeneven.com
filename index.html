	<h1>Hi there, I'm Tristen!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. 
	   This website is intended to illustrate my journey through study, and 
	   create a history of my personal projects. I hope to make regular updates,
	   posts, and continue to expand the capabilities of the site. Have a look around!</a></p>
