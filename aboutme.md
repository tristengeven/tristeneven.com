My name is Tristen Even. I was born in 1998 in the small farmtown of Lancaster, Texas. I moved nearer towards the city of Dallas itself every few years as my parents made their way into the middle class, and now live right outside of Dallas proper. I study computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas, but am currently living in Berlin for a year through the CBYX Youth Exchange for Young Professionals. In my free time I play Rugby (currently with the RK03 Berlin Rugby Klub, normally with the UTD Men's Team), ride BMX & Mountainbike, and attempt photography. The dog in the picture is Sanko; he lives with me in Berlin. We like to do things together.

Most of my personal projects revolve around Python or Javascript. I work currently in the Infrastructure Systems field, but am studying and seeking to expand into the realm of fullstack development.
