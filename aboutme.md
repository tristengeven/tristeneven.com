My name is Tristen Even. Born in the small town of Lancaster, Texas in 1998, I was raised on a sheep farm until the age of four. My family then progressively moved closer to the city of Dallas as my parents made their way into the middle class. Today my father is a Captain in the Fire Department, and my mother is an assistant principal. I study computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas, but am currently living in Berlin for a year through the CBYX Youth Exchange for Young Professionals.
