Who am I? 
I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
That's not soon enough! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Moving alongâ€¦ There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!
I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!
With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! I'm a thing. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Is the Space Pope reptilian!?
I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.
